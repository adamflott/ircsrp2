Immediately fixable known issues:
* Key change messages are accepted from anybody. [security]
* Truncated topics and messages fail to decrypt.
    * Could be fixed by splitting too-long messages into shorter ones.  IRC
        RFC specifies max command message length.  Too-long messages could be
        split up automatically.
* The code needs a refactor.  I started with the goal of keeping the original
    reference implementation separate and unmodified.  That didn't end up
    working out and the code could be greatly simplified with a small amount
    of refactoring.
* A status bar widget to show encryption status of a channel would be great.
* SRP config options do not allow for a user named "default"

Other known issues:
* IRC server could spoof appearance of encrypted message.
    * I need unspoofable markup to indicate encrypted message via the UI
* Hard wired to IRC only.
* Roster pickle load fails if script is in autoload directory.
* Nick collisions on multiple irc networks might cause issues.
* Are SRP user names case sensitive?  SRP user config opts are not.
